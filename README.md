# React Test Assessment

## Prerequisites

This application requires Node V10+ and npm V6+

## Quick Start

```
npm install (Or yarn install)
npm start (Or yarn start)
```

## Description

This application was built with React, Redux, Material UI.

Currently, when refreshing the page, store data is reset because this assessment doesn't require middle implementation. In order to keep the store data with refresh, please enable the commented code in redux/reducer.js

In this application, I did not add the test cases becase it doesn't require at this moment. If required, I can add the testing code with react testing library or jest, enzyme easily.
